<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I am a postdoc with <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/details/amy-bastian">Amy Bastian</a> in the Department of Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and the <a href="https://www.kennedykrieger.org/research/centers-labs-cores/center-for-movement-studies">Center for Movement Studies</a>, Kennedy Krieger Institute. I am a physical therapist by training and interested in the neuroscience of motor control and learning and the application of these principles to physical rehabilitation. I am passionate about stroke care and I hope that my study of the movement system will eventually help me to translate the science to the clinic. <br><br>

I completed my doctoral work with <a href="https://pt.usc.edu/faculty/carolee-j-winstein-phd-pt-fapta/">Carolee Winstein</a> in the <a href="https://www.mbnl.usc.edu">Motor Behavior and Neurorehabilitation Laboratory</a> in the Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy at the University of Southern California. My dissertation work focused on characterizing hemisphere-specific deficits in bimanual control after stroke.</p>
